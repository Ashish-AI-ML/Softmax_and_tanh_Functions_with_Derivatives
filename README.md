What is Softmax_and_tanh_Functions_with_Derivatives and its use ?
Softmax and tanh Functions with Derivatives - Visualization and Comparison
This project provides a combined visualization of two essential activation functions used in neural networks:

Softmax function and its derivatives (Jacobian diagonal)
tanh function and its derivative
It is designed to help you understand their behaviors, derivatives, and appropriate use cases in deep learning.

🔢 Softmax Function
Formula:

math
\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_j e^{x_j}}
Purpose: Converts a vector of real values into a probability distribution.
Range: Values between 0 and 1 that sum to 1.
Common Use: Final layer in classification problems (e.g., image classification, NLP).
Derivative: Returns a Jacobian matrix used during backpropagation.
🔁 tanh Function
Formula:

math
\tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}
Purpose: Outputs zero-centered values.
Range: Values between -1 and 1.
Common Use: Hidden layers in neural networks.
Derivative:
math
\tanh'(x) = 1 - \tanh^2(x)
Advantage: Helps avoid bias shifts and gradient saturation compared to sigmoid.
📊 Combined Visualization
The chart plots:

Softmax outputs for a 3-element input vector as one element varies
Diagonal of the softmax Jacobian matrix (derivatives)
tanh function curve
Derivative of tanh
This helps compare:

Smoothness
Sensitivity to inputs
Behavior over the same input domain
💡 Why This Matters
Feature	Softmax	tanh
Output Range	(0, 1), sum = 1	(-1, 1)
Use Case	Final output in classifiers	Hidden layer activation
Non-linearity	Yes	Yes
Derivative Shape	Varies with input vector	Peaks at 0, symmetric
Problem Solving	Class probability	Feature transformation
🛠️ Usage
